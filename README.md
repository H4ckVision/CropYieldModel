# CropYieldModel
This repository contains a **Flask-based web application** that predicts crop yield based on input features such as rainfall, soil quality, farm size, sunlight, and fertilizer usage. The app uses a trained machine learning model (`Crop_Yield_model.pkl`) to make predictions and provides a user-friendly GUI for input and output.

## Features
- **Input Features**:
  - Rainfall (mm)
  - Soil Quality Index
  - Farm Size (hectares)
  - Sunlight (hours)
  - Fertilizer (kg)
- **Output**: Predicted crop yield.
- **User Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for input and results.
- **Deployment**: Ready for deployment on platforms like **Render** or **Heroku**.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (or TensorFlow/PyTorch, depending on your model)
- **Deployment**: Render (or any other cloud platform)

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-prediction-app.git
   cd crop-yield-prediction-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the App Locally**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

4. **Deploy on Render**:
   - Push the code to GitHub.
   - Connect the repository to Render and deploy the app.
